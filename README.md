## Action setup guide

### Pull Request

.github/workflows/main.yml

```yml
name: checkpatch review
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  my_review:
    name: checkpatch review
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
    - name: Run checkpatch review
      uses: webispy/checkpatch-action@master
```

For using a custom checkpatch script, pass the `CHECKPATCH_COMMAND` environment
variable. For example, for DPDK's `checkpatches.sh` script use:

```yml
name: checkpatch review
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  my_review:
    name: checkpatch review
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
    - name: Run DPDK checkpatches.sh review
      uses: webispy/checkpatch-action@master
      env:
        DPDK_CHECKPATCH_PATH: /usr/bin/checkpatch.pl
        CHECKPATCH_COMMAND: ./devtools/checkpatches.sh
```

**Note:** For **private repositories** this action needs access to the `GITHUB_TOKEN`. It needs read access to `contents` and `pull-requests` as minimum permissions. For example:
```yml
name: checkpatch review
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  my_review:
    name: checkpatch review
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: read
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
    - name: Run checkpatch review
      uses: webispy/checkpatch-action@master
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
```
